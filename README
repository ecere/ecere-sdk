The Ecere SDK v0.44 - http://ecere.com

Free Open Source Software released under the New BSD license.

The Ecere SDK is a Software Development Kit including:

   * A set of compiling tools for the eC programming language
                               ( http://www.ecere.com/technologies.html#eC )

   * An Integrated Development Environment, with the usual features such as:
      - A source code editor with auto-completion, syntax highlighting
      - Management of application and library projects
      - A visual debugger
      - A Rapid Application Development form designer, based on
        properties & methods 

   * A run time library, providing a uniform API across platforms, featuring:
      - A GUI toolkit (with a vast collection of powerful controls:
        Buttons, Edit boxes, Drop/Combo boxes, Menus, Tabs,
        Tree views/Grids/List boxes, file dialogs, ...)
      - A 2D graphics API (bitmaps, fonts, international text, basic drawing)
      - A 3D graphics API, supporting both Direct3D and OpenGL
        (3DS file format support)
      - A networking API which provide Sockets as well as a
        distributed objects system for eC
      - System functionality such as file access, multi-threading &
        synchronization, handling date & time, etc.

   * Additional libraries and code for more features, such as:
      - The Ecere Data Access (EDA) layer, an abstract relational database
        API, providing an active record system for eC. Currently it has
        drivers for a minimal Ecere RDBMS and SQLite (as well as an encrypted
        version using SQLiteCipher), and recently a basic Oracle driver was
        introduced
      - An audio library (supporting DirectSound on Windows and ALSA on Linux)
      - WIA Scanning support on Windows
      - SSL Sockets suport through OpenSSL
      - A 2D tiled based game graphics engine (Tiled map, Sprites, A*)

 * INSTALLATION *

Please refer to the latest instructions at http://ecere.com/wiki/
Windows binaries are available from that page.

Daily-built Ubuntu Debian packages are available from our Ubuntu PPA:

   https://code.launchpad.net/~ecere-team/+archive/ppa

To build from source, simply type make (mingw32-make on Windows).

It should build fine on Linux, on Windows with MinGW,
and on Mac OS X with a bit of luck.

To install, type make install (mingw32-make install on Windows).

Please note that at this time eC and the Ecere SDK only support 32 bit.
However, you should still be able to use the 32 bit version on a 64 bit machine.
64-bit support is planned for the future.

 * DOCUMENTATION *

The Ecere Tao of Programming is a Programmer's Guide (still work in progress)
that will teach you the foundations of eC and Ecere. You will find it under:

Online: http://ecere.com/tao.pdf
On Windows:
      %PROGRAMFILES%\Ecere SDK\doc\Ecere Tao of Programming [work in progress].pdf
On Linux/Unix: /usr/share/doc/tao.pdf

Please check out the samples that come with the SDK:

On Windows they get installed in %APPDATA%\Ecere SDK\Samples
On Linux/Unix they get installed in /usr/share/ecere/samples/
You can also find the latest versions on GitHub:

   http://github.com/ecere/sdk/tree/master/samples
   http://github.com/ecere/fractals
   http://github.com/ecere/chess

The Documentor is a tool under development to browse and document the APIs of
eC modules. You can use it to browse all available classes, methods and properties
of the Ecere runtime library.
However, at the moment the tool itself is being improved, and so not much 
descriptive info has been added yet.
