 This software makes use of other software components whose licenses may also
 apply, which are found in their respective source directories (most under
 deps/).
 .
  Among them: zlib, libpng, libjpeg, giflib, harfbuzz, freetype, tango icons
 .
  The IDE also communicates with GCC for compiling (MinGW on Windows), GDB for
  debugging, and UPX for optionally compressing executables. Each of these have
  their own license which can be found in their respective documentation folder
  if distributed along with the SDK (in the case of the Windows version) or
  from wherever you obtained them.
