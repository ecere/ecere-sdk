# Because -D_FORTIFY_SOURCE works in a non-standard way
# (i.e. it is not handled by the preprocessor),
# and the C code generated by eC is preprocessed
# before being compiled to C code, which does not
# include the C header files for the functions, but
# rather define its own prototypes, fortify functions
# is not supported in eC.
