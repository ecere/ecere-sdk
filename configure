echo "The Ecere cross-platform SDK is pre-configured. Just type:

 Linux:      make

 FreeBSD:    gmake

 Windows:    mingw32-make

   You need MinGW or MinGW-w64. We recommend TDM-GCC.
   For best results, use the version bundled with the latest Ecere installer for Windows.
           ( http://ecere.org/install/windows )

 OS X:

   First add your toolchain bin directory to the path and set SYSROOT to the SDK directory. e.g. with Xcode 5.1.1:

   export PATH=$PATH:/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin
   export SYSROOT=/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.9.sdk

   make

   Last tested on OS X™ Mavericks with XCode 5.1.1.
   Please note that debugger integration only supports GDB and will not work with LLDB. It's also recommended to install XQuartz.

 Other UNIX systems:

   Given various degrees of efforts, it should be possible to build on other UNIX platforms. You will need a recent version of GNU Make (gmake).
   GCC or Clang is required for your C compiler. (TCC might work too)
   X86, AMD64, PowerPC, 32 bit ARM architectures are all known to work.
   Some assumptions about the C types are currently made. (e.g. char: signed 1 byte, int: 4 bytes, float: 4 bytes, double: 8 bytes)
   If your platform offers no way to conform to these assumptions, there would be a lot of code to reconsider.

   Please get in touch with us for help or to coordinate efforts improving platform support.
