 - ide
    - this report is wrong I think -- creating new file in a newly created project will leak recent files to the master (no-project/no-workspace) recent files.
      this has been fixed.... the correct report should have been this: saving newly created file will add to global recent files instead of workspace recent files.
 - epj2make
    - giving path to a non-existant project file will print out error but will not return error code
    - support per bit depth configuration for ffi
                  src/x86/$(PLATFORM_OBJ).S instead of src/x86/win32.S vs src/x86/win64.S
 - ide/epj2make
    - add gui for makefile insertion points for freetype (to insert before targets)
                  # SAFETY
                  _IGNORE := $(if $(findstring -O2,$(PRJ_CFLAGS)),$(info Warning: Compiling with -O2 gives 0 font height with MinGW!!),)
