On Windows, applications built statically with the MinGW-w64 runtime should
include the MinGW-w64 runtime license in their application.
   See ecere-sdk/extras/res/licenses/MinGW-w64.LICENSE or
       Program Files/Ecere SDK/tdm/licenses/COPYING.MinGW-w64-runtime.txt

The Ecere IDE also communicates with GCC for compiling
(MinGW/MinGW-w64 on Windows), GDB for debugging, and UPX for optionally
compressing executables.

Each of these have their own license, which can be found from wherever you
obtained them or under:
   Program Files/Ecere SDK/tdm/licenses/  and
   Program Files/Ecere SDK/upx/doc/
if distributed with the Ecere SDK Windows installer.
