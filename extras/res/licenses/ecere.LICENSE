This software makes use of other software components whose licenses may also 
apply, which are found in their respective source directories (most under
deps/). Among them: zlib, libpng, libjpeg, giflib, harfbuzz, freetype...

The IDE also communicates with GCC for compiling (MinGW on Windows), GDB for 
debugging, and UPX for optionally compressing executables. Each of these have 
their own license which can be found in their respective documentation folder 
if distributed along with the SDK (in the case of the Windows version) or
from wherever you obtained them.
